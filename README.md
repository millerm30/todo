# {Drag & Drop} To-Do Web App
![App Logo](images/todologo.jpg)

This is my first project as a student of Get Coding. This web app is written with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
This web app allows users to create notes that become draggable from 3 drop areas. Along with the draggable notes, this app also includes the users local weather built with Open Weather API and an app widget area that includes a functional calculator app.

This application was created to create an all in one application that can be used to track daily tasks in my current role as a  project manager, reducing the need for multiple applications.



## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm currently a student with [Get Coding](http://www.get-coding.ca) completing Full Stack Development.


## Features

- Drag and Drop Function for new notes

## Installation

To use this project locally please install AXIOS via NPM. For a functional weather API the user will also require the creation 
of a config.js file in their local javascript directory and include their API KEY in this file. Please signup for your API key with https://openweathermap.org/

To create your local config.js file.

'use strict';

const config = {

};
