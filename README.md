# {Drag & Drop} To-Do Web App

This is my first project as a student of Get Coding. This web app is wriitten with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
This web app allows users to create notes that become draggable from 3 drop areas. Along with the draggable notes, this app also includes the users local weather built with Open Weather API and an app widget area that includes a functional calculator app.

This application was created to create an all in one application that can be used to track daily tasks in my current role as a  project manager.
